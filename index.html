        <h2>The Wolf & the Crane</h2>
        <p>A Wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in his throat.<br> He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing.<br> Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy Wolf.<br>So away he hurried to the Crane. <br>He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out.<br>"I will reward you very handsomely," said the Wolf, "if you pull that bone out for me."<br>The Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a Wolf's thsroat.<br> But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do.<br>When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away."But what about my reward!" called the Crane anxiously.<br>"What!" snarled the Wolf, whirling around.<br> "Haven't you got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping it off?"

        <h2>The Wolf & the Ass</h2>
        <p> An Ass was feeding in a pasture near a wood when he saw a Wolf lurking in the shadows along the hedge.<br> He easily guessed what the Wolf had in mind, and thought of a plan to save himself. <br> So he pretended he was lame, and began to hobble painfully.<br>When the Wolf came up, he asked the Ass what had made him lame, and the Ass replied that he had stepped on a sharp thorn.<br>"Please pull it out," he pleaded, groaning as if in pain. "If you do not, it might stick in your throat when you eat me."<br> The Wolf saw the wisdom of the advice, for he wanted to enjoy his meal without any danger of choking.<br> So the Ass lifted up his foot and the Wolf began to search very closely and carefully for the thorn.<br>Just then the Ass kicked out with all his might, tumbling the Wolf a dozen paces away. <br>And while the Wolf was getting very slowly and painfully to his feet, the Ass galloped away in safety.<br>"Serves me right," growled the Wolf as he crept into the bushes. <br>"I'm a butcher by trade, not a doctor."
